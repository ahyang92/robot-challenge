### Near Future Enhancements

These are the planned features and improvements that are coming in the near future:

- **Allow setting table dimensions**  
  Enable users to define custom dimensions for the table on which the robot operates.

- **Allow setting origin (including negative coordinates)**  
  Allow users to set the robot's starting position with flexibility, including support for negative coordinates.

- **Add 'reset' command**  
  Introduce a command that resets the robot by removing it from the table.

- **Add 'undo' command**  
  Implement an 'undo' feature to restore the robot to its previous position, providing more control and flexibility.

- **Support 'step' for movement**  
  Add a feature to move the robot in bigger steps (>1), enhancing precision when positioning it on the table.

- **More Test coverage**  
  Add tests for command lines behaviors, movement mapping, etc.

### Far Future Enhancements (Big Upgrades)

These are some ambitious plans for the future:

- **Support for 0-360 degree rotation**  
  Enable the robot to rotate seamlessly across all angles, from 0 to 360 degrees, offering full rotation flexibility.

- **Support for decimal-based coordinates**  
  Allow the use of decimal points in coordinates for even more precise positioning.

- **Multiple robots on a single base**  
  Expand the functionality to support multiple robots working together on the same base, allowing for more complex scenarios and interactions.

- **Support for the Z-axis (whoa!)**  
  The ability to move the robot in 3D space, adding support for the Z-axis. It's time for the next dimension!
